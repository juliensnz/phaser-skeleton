# Extra simple phaser js skeleton

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm start
```

Put your code in the app folder

You can start by adding stuff in the `app/State/Main.ts` file

## Add a typing

When you want to use an external library to your project which doesn't exist in typescript, you can do the following:

```bash
typings install lodash --save --global
```

## Add a new dependency:

```bash
npm install lodash --save
```

Enjoy :)
